        <p>FabulitSA is a business of mine that I started late 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown period. 
            I had gotten the idea from a business my aunt had run before and added my own 
            twist to it by not just selling hair, but including lashes and then eventually makeup products.
            I didn't make a lot of sales during 2021,but I continued pushing, 
            trying to find what I was trying to sell and what type of aestetic I was going for, to what type of audience I wanted to attract.
        <br><br>

        In this concept I focused my attention on bringing my lash products to life. So lighting, dominance, scale and contrast were important in bringing 
        emphasis to the main focal points, which were the lashes.

            <p>I used a black and white filter because I thought it brought the concepts to life compared to normal colour.
                The shadows at the back were softened , the contrast of black and greys between the lash applicator stick
                and the lash for balance and emphasis of the lashes. I did not want lighting to be too exposed, I added a 
                little bit of exposure to further seperate the foreground from the background.
